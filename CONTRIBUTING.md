# Contribution Guidelines
Unfortunately, not every library, tool or framework can be considered for inclusion. The aim of Awesome PHP is to be a concise list of noteworthy and interesting software written in modern PHP. Therefore, suggested software should:

1. Be widely recommended
2. Well known or discussed within the PHP community
3. Be unique in its approach or function
4. Fill a niche gap in the market

Self-promotion is frowned upon, so please consider seriously whether your project meets the criteria before opening a pull request, otherwise it may be closed without being reviewed.

Also, please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Software that is PHP 7.0+, Composer-installable, PSR compliant, semantically versioned, unit tested, actively maintained and well documented in English.
* Please search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Enter a meaningful pull request description.
* Please make an individual commit for each suggestion in a separate pull request.
* Put a link to each library in your pull request ticket so it's easier to review.
* Use the following format for libraries: \[LIBRARY\]\(LINK\) - DESCRIPTION.
* Prefix duplicate library names with their vendor or namespace followed by a space: Foo\Bar would be Foo Bar.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorisation, are always welcome.
* Please keep descriptions short, simple and unbiased. No buzzwords or marketing jargon.
* End all descriptions with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
* Your entry has been added alphabetically within the category.

Thank you for your suggestions!
