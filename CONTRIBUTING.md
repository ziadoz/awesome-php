# Contribution Guidelines
The aim of Awesome PHP is to be a concise list of the best packages, frameworks, tools and software the PHP ecosystem has to offer. Unfortunately this means not everything can or should be included. Therefore, suggested software should ideally be one of the following:

* Widely known or recognised within the PHP community
* Established and mature
* Unique in its approach
* Fulfill a niche gap in the market

Where applicable, preference will be give to software that:

* Targets supported versions of PHP
* Can be installed using Composer
* Is PSR compliant
* Semantically versioned
* Thoroughly tested
* Actively maintained
* Well documented in English

Also, please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Your suggestion hasn't been previously rejected or is a duplicate, otherwise it will be closed.
* Write a meaningful pull request description which includes a link to the project.
* Adheres to the following Markdown format: `[LIBRARY](LINK) - DESCRIPTION.`
* Your description is short, clear, unbiased, and doesn't contain any jargon.
* The description ends with a full stop/period and no trailing whitespace.
* You've checked your spelling and grammar.
* Your entry is added alphabetically to the category.
* The library is prefixed with the vendor name (e.g. `Foo\Bar` becomes `Foo Bar`) if it shares the same name as another entry.
* Feel free to suggest new categories or organisational improvements.

Please make sure your suggestion meets all the criteria before submitting a pull request, or it may be closed without review.

Thank you for your suggestions!
